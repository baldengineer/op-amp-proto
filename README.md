## Op Amp board for Prototyping and testing Op Amps
This board characterizes op amps in an SOIC-8 breakout board. The bottom layer is solid copper. The top has copper guard bands. There are solder jumps to connect the copper pours whatever pin is GND on the SOIC.

Turns out, if you bend the leads, version 1 can fit a DIP.

The "top" and "bottom" 2.54 mm holes are intended for power rails.
